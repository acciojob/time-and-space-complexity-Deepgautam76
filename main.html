	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in algorithm analysis, determining how efficiently an algorithm performs as input size grows. A well-optimized algorithm has better time complexity, ensuring efficient execution.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the input size. An algorithm with space complexity of O(n) utilizes memory proportional to the input, ensuring optimal resource usage.</p>
