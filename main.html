	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity quantifies how an algorithm's execution time scales with the size of its input. that is also a efficient.
	</p>
	<p>
		Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to execute, measured as a function of the input size if a code take the space of n then <b>Space Compexity</b>, O(n).
